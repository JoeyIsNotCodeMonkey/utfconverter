This program works on ubuntu but NOT sparky, maybe a little bit...

All kinds of UTF convertion works, the "-vvv" function only works on UTF8 to UTF8,16LE,16BE. Printing only works partially for the rest convertion.

Except these two problems, everything else should meet the requirment, please check and be mercy!
